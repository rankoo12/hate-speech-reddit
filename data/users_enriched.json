Tyson also plans to cut one of the two shifts at a plant in Amarillo, Texas, and eliminate 1,700 jobs there. Together those two moves will reduce beef processing capacity nationwide by 7-9%.\nTwo slaughterhouses control 7-9% of the US's capacity? Why did this happen?\nBut in the long run, beef prices may continue to climb even higher than the current record highs — caused by a variety of factors from drought to tariffs — unless American ranchers decide to raise more cattle, which they have little incentive to do.\nOh no. This is huge? Who could have predicted such dire consequences?\nBleak outlook for US farmers – and Trump tariffs could make it worse - Dec 2024\nOh, right everyone predicted this.",

He threatened to expose them and coerced them into recruiting new victims, forming a pyramid-like blackmail ring on the app that produced and shared manipulated sexual images of their targets, most of whom were minors, according to details of the crimes revealed in court.\nKim raped or assaulted 16 victims, including 14 minors, and recorded videos of his crimes in 13 of those cases. He created roughly 1,700 sexually exploitative images or videos targeting about 70 victims, disseminating around 260 of them online to threaten those who refused to cooperate, and also attempted to blackmail some of the victims’ family members and work colleagues, the court said.\nPyramid-like blackmail ring isn't something I was expecting to read this morning. People, don't take nekked pictures of yourself. And if you must take nekked pictures of yourself, don't share them.",

However, her character's sister Queenie (played by Alison Sudol) has a very specific New York accent. It's been bothering me more and more when film/TV siblings have different accents. Especially when they're close in age and don't have an in-universe excuse for sounding different. Jacob and Queenie sound like they're from New York. Tina doesn't. Generally, accents get developed early (between ages 3-5) and usually form from a peer group (like a sibling).",

Langford had a 22/22 season in home runs and stolen bases -- so didn't come all that close to 30/30 -- and didn't crack the top 10 in MVP voting, but he did finish with 5.6 WAR, which ranked tied for eighth among American League position players. Part of the high WAR was his outstanding defense, but also that, for whatever reason, Globe Life Field played as an extreme pitcher's park in 2025, so Langford finished with an excellent 127 OPS+.\nGrade: B-\nLooking ahead to 2026: Langford played 134 games, so if he can get up to 150 and if Globe Life returns to more of a neutral park, 30/30 will be on the radar. If he can cut down on his strikeouts -- 16th percentile -- then we'll see even bigger offensive numbers across the board.",

In addition, he was responsible for the slaughter of several Autobots, such as Ratchet and Leadfoot. He wanted to return Optimus to his real employers, the Creators, in exchange for the payment.",

In any case, it was touching that at the end of the season, when Eleven uses her powers to destroy the Demogorgon, she also disappears, and Will is brought back from the Upside Down.",

The scenes in the Hawkins laboratory in the second season, with the Demodogs and the final boss fight against the Mind Flayer, were very well done. The third season, on the other hand, was very awkward and childish, unlike the fourth season, which rediscovered its identity. I hope the fifth season will maintain this standard.",

      "text": "From years ago, I know a lesbian couple who walked to Texas from Honduras, crossed the border, and turned themselves in to request asylum. (Honduras is one of the most dangerous places for queer folk.) They were detained for nine months until a community group sponsored them and they got out of detention. The conditions were so horrific and dehumanizing, the food so meager and so awful. One adult, an adult woman admittedly on the small side, weighed 78 pounds when she got out. When I met her, she weighed around 100 and was still too skinny.\nIt's been shameful and awful for years, but now it's so expansive. So many people are trapped.\nI'm with you. It's heartbreaking.\nEDIT: typos",

And then I just hung it up there with some fishing line, zip ties, and those cable control tabs, I forget what they're called. My crabs LOVE those begeterday moss things. I have one that's vertical, and they climb that all the time. I use two others as places to hang out in the topper. When I rebuild the topper to add a lot more stuff in a few weeks, I'm going to add more, both for hang out spots and for climbing.\nThe only issue with the two that function as mossy shelves is that sometimes they dig in them and sort of expose some of the fishing line that kind of holds it together, but then I just take loose moss (same brand, a little goes a long way when you rehydrate it) and plop it down in that spot, and they have fun digging it up again.\nAnd yes, sometimes they eat the furniture. 😂😂😂 My crab who just buried himself again (I assume--he's normally first on the wheel at night and last off in the morning, and I haven't seen him in a couple days) likes to just eat the moss.",

A modest home with a backyard is around 465 sq meters. So simple math, 830k * 465m\n2\nwhich is about 386 km\n2.\nThat is only how much space houses would take\nNow if we had infrastructure. Let’s make it simple and say the only infrastructure is roads and parking. That adds about 20% if you’re being\nextremely\nconservative. So, final size is 500 km\n2.\nThat’s 5x the size of Paris.\nAnd then keep in mind we did this math for\njust\nmanhattan. Let’s add the 5 Burroughs, and calculate including zoning ordinances and let’s say there’s a Gaussian distribution of housing sizes between 300m\n2\nand 800m\n2.\nThat adds up to 4400km\n2,\nor effectively, the size of Delaware or about 40x the size of paris\nNow let’s look into traffic. This would be like driving from the inland empire to Los Angeles proper in the worst case scenario, so your commute would be roughly 2.5 hours if you went from one side to the other in rush hour traffic. In gridlock traffic, that’s about 4 hours\nCars ain’t it dude",

      "text": "The cloth is significant to the Haudenosaunee; they historically wove their treaties into “belts”, and George Washington commissioned such a belt for this treaty. Here is a description of how it works:\nDarlene Whitetree is about to enact a vital component of a 217-year-old agreement between the United States and the people of the Six Nations, but to the unknowing observer, it’ll look like she’s doing nothing more than merely chatting on the phone. Sometime this August, she’ll be able to tick a seemingly prosaic item off her to-do list by simply making a phone call and placing an order for bolts of muslin cloth to be delivered to Indian nations scattered throughout western New York state. She will then move on to her other tasks as acting superintendent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Eastern Cherokee office in North Carolina. No big deal, right?\nYet that seemingly insignificant transaction—arranging for the shipping of that cloth—is the mandated annual fulfillment of an agreement made in 1794, in the small town of Canandaigua, New York, that dictates how relations between Indian nations and the U.S. government are handled to this day—that is, nation to nation, with states, counties, and other lesser U.S. government agencies falling to the wayside.\nhttps://ictnews.org/archive/treaty-of-canandaigua-remains-a-powerful-symbol-of-native-sovereignty/",

      "text": "You just explained why the ultimate premise of \"supply-side economics\" is total BS that government sold society hook, line, and sinker. It's not merely callous and immoral, it\ndoes not work in principle.\nEver since the Great Depression, it was widely known that market access and availability is\nthe\nmost important, most coveted asset known to capitalism - more important than oil, rare earths, AI technology, or anything else. In capitalism,\nproducing is always easier than selling\n, because production costs go\ndown\nwith economies of scale, while selling costs go\nup\nas the market saturates and its buying power reaches limit. When the market cannot consume what's being produced, the economy implodes.\nNeoliberalism is the cancer that is the root cause of most of the problems faced by Western societies today. The only reason it survived as long as it did is because it was started from a position of industrial and geopolitical dominance - allowing the US to treat the entire world as its one-way market. Well, this dominance is now gone, and the illusion of neoliberal prosperity went up in smoke together with it. Our economy spent the last 40 years in \"sell off the house assets to pay for the drug habit\" mode, and we're all outta assets.\nAI only accelerates the inevitable. Either this crisis ends with New Deal-level reforms and the acknowledgement that Keynesian government-driven demand creation is\nnecessary\n(not only morally, to benefit common people, but purely structurally, for capitalism itself to survive) or we are entering a period of chaos and violence, as does any society which crosses the threshold where inequality does not only result in poor quality of life for most people, but the very inability of the economic system to function in the first place.",

      "text": "I like the artistic design choice of HD more than 2 (although I like the technical crispness of the graphics and responsiveness of the controls of 2 better).\nBut the biggest reason I think HD is a better game is that HD is one of the most \"complete\" games I ever played. Except for a few minor mechanics (like web gun or camera being kinda useless and annoying to see in shops), everything just perfectly falls into place. The length is exactly right. The items are balanced. The difficulty, while hard, feels fair (every time you die you know it's\nyour\nfault and you could have done better next time.) There are usually several different ways of doing things, none inherently better than the other. The rogue-lite interactions are near-perfect. You can play in very unorthodox ways, and no matter what you, get get the \"yeah, that makes sense it'd behave like that\" feeling.\nWhen you beat HD, you really get a sense of having finished the game. It didn't feel too short, too long, too grindy, too unbalanced, too simple, too complex, too unfair, or too boring. It just feels like a Game. Made. Right. The best way to compare the satisfaction I got from beating Spelunky is beating some of the best games made by Valve, such as Half-Life 2 or Portal.\nSpelunky 2 builds on that, but it doesn't quite get the \"completeness\" formula as right as HD did. It's harder, less balanced, feels a bit protracted at times, and some strats are just worse than others. It's still a great game, but doesn't quite reach the bar of HD's near-perfection.\nI wish there was an HD remake using the 2's engine.",
